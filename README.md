## About
dovShop is a powerful package manager for iOS devices. It is designed to help you keep all your packages organized in one neat app. The app contains a sources tab where you can install online sources that contain packages not apart of the default source. This gives you the ability to organize packages from many various sources all within one powerful manager!

## Installation
There are two main ways to install the dovShop Package manager on to your phone. If you have an Apple Developer Account or used a service such as [UDID Registrations](https://www.udidregistrations.com) and are thus able to sideload more then 3 apps please use the iPA version.

However if that is not the case due to not wanting to take up extra space for sideloading apps there is a PWA option. The Progressive Web App is essentially a web based version of the dovShop app and works just like the iPA version. This version is preferred since it will not be counted towards the 3 apps Apple allows for normal sideloading.
